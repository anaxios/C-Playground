# On the Grid

*This has not been tested for actual use*

Type the command into your terminal followed by your master password then the URL 
and it will produce your grid and your site password.

currently only works with at least 6 UPPERCASE letters in the url.

for example:
`> ./latin-square monkey123 AMAZON`

If you only put your master password and no url it will produce your grid

based on Steve Gibson's cool [Off the Grid](https://www.grc.com/offthegrid.htm) System.
