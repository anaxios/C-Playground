# On the Grid

*This has not been tested for actual use*

Type the command into your terminal followed by your master password then the URL 
and it will produce your grid and your site password.


for example:
`> ./latin-square monkey123 aol.com`

If you only put your master password and no url it will produce your grid.

If you want a random grid: `> ./latin-square`
